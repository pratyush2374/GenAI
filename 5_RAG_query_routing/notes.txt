Routing - Step after query translation 
---------------------------------------

No fix method or formula 

Types of routing
    Logical routing
        Points to the correct data place 
        When making vector embeddings dont mix up data from different sources, make seperate namespaces for them 
        Based on the user qury which is the best data source that i should look on and then give the data source names what all you have 
        Now based on the output seach the revelant namespace instead of searching everywhere
        A business has a lots of data if proper seperation is not made the similarity serach will give lots of docs and it'll take time as well 
    Semantic routing
        Used when making a specific RAG when there are few tasks only 
        We predefine prompts and their detailed description with placeholders eg - [date range], for all out tasks and then based on the user prompt LLM maps the user prompts to our written prompts

Graph DB


- Vector DB
    Vector DBs are good till a limit
    We lose on relations in vector DB, we need context, which is not the case in Graph DBs
    
We we are chunking for each chunk we are getting entities from it through and LLM
Converting the chunks into vectors and entities into node and defining relationships between them 
When user queries we find relevant chunks from vector DB 
Now we ask the LLM to again find entities from the found chunks 
Then we find those entities in the graph DB and derive a relationship between them 
We give both the found chunks and relationships to the LLM 
Now we have a more better context related answer
